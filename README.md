## Demo

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript
- REST API
- CSS

## Description

The Notes App is an application that allows users to add study courses, attach notes to them, and view the created notes.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

npm install
npm run dev
http://localhost:5173/

## Use of AI

AI was used as a support tool especially for styling, ideation, and problem-solving. AI was not used to generate finished solutions, but to provide suggestions and direction, based on which the functionality was implemented manually.

AI was also used to support debugging and error investigation. For example, AI suggested an approach for formatting timestamps, and its correctness was verified by implementing and testing it independently.

All solutions have been understood and implemented by myself.

## Project Status and Future Development

This project was completed as a course final assignment. The goal was to practice React fundamentals and REST API usage.

The application is functional, but still has some minor limitations. Possible future improvements include:

- Full responsiveness for different screen sizes
- Unifying ID values between notes fetched from the REST API and locally created notes
  -  Currently, locally created note IDs are based on timestamps
- Notes list filtering
  - Ability to reset filtering so that all notes are visible again
